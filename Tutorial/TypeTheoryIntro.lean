open Nat -- imports from other files is done via open keyword

-- `=` is reserved for Equality in the usual programming sense (`==` has also a meaning, namely bitwise equality)

-- Use eval to try out the result of a computation,
-- while coding, instead of fully building your project

-- Lean is camelCase for `defs` and CamelCase for types

-- To get the type of a term use the check mackro (# prefixes macros)
#check 2


-- EXERCISE:
-- Everything is a type, so what is the type of double_down?
-- HINT: prefix function names with `@` to get more details from the #check macro

--

-- You can also write functions like this

def my_personal_function (name: String) := s!"Hello {name}"

-- Unit is Lean's null type and is stated explictly as ()
-- _ is a place holder, use it when you're not sure what to put here and maybe lean can figure it out

-- This is the reason why they seem to be everywhere. They're just translations of classical programming patterns into the
-- functional paradigm. Nevertheless they outside the scope of this tutorial.

-- Lean can actually sugar coat such logic and allows us to write sequential logic without much fuzz,
-- if we're using the right keywords to fire up the power of Monads.

-- Some further notes. LEAN version 4 is still under development
-- meaning that sometimes weird things happen, (e.g. I often encounter compiler errors 
-- if my file contains commented code at the end of the file), so sometimes
-- behavior can be a bit weird or slow. Usually this resolves itself if
-- you help the compiler with annotating types (and checking if you got the syntax correct),
-- or restarting the lean plugin/server.
-- But if nothing helps and you're 110% sure that it is LEAN's fault (happens only 0.0001% of the time), 
-- try out version 3 as it stable and doesn't have any shanigans (though the syntax is slightly different)
