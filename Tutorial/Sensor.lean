  Why didn't we include the body of workingSensorCriteria directly in workingSensor?
  Because
  1. Nested Expressions like Except.toBool (if ... then ...)
  can be hard to prove as goal and it's simpler to argue about
  Except.toBool (someFunX)
  2. Readability, breaking up methods (especially in the functional paradigm)
  makes our intend easier to understand.
  This may seem obvious as a coding pattern, but has a special dimension in 
  in lean, as it influences lean's ability to simplify and reduce expressions.
  3. Performance, lean also has an easier time to compile your code and cache previous
  results from other definitions.

  To sum up, it's really helpful to keep everything short and separate. 
  Take a look into the Mathlib source code and you will
  notice that most proofs are not longer than 5 lines.
