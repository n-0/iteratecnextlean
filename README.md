# iteratecnextlean (2023)

Welcome and thanks for choosing this workshop! I'm looking forward to dive right into the magical deep sea of interactive theorem provers
(ITP) with you. Before we get on board, let's check if you have everything you need: 

1. a computer (probably checked)
2. cloned this repository (probably checked)
3. Installed lean 


Lean3 was a one-way installation while it's newest reincarnation lean4 (still unstable), has elan, a toolchain manager! (sth. like `nvm` or `rustup` [actually it's based on rust's manager]), allowing you to have multiple versions of lean.
In most cases it's enough to have [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the lean4 (extensions)[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=leanprover.lean4], which should get everything setup for you.

* install vscode extension 
* Open this repository in vscode (having the extension installed)
* Open the file `Tutorial.lean` and continue!
